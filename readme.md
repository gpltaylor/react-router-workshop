# React Router Workshop
A collection of mini projects showing the core features of React Router. 
You can run each example by navigating to the folder and typing

```
npm install
npm start
```

All the examples use create-react-app as their base.

## The Goal
To teach other (and myself) the inner working of React Router.

## Coming Soon
I am going to update the mono repo to use Lerna so I can handle all the dependencies correctly.

## Help
In you're interested in taking part, then send a PR or message me.
